## A2.2 Investigate/Requirements Report

DATE: Nov 4,2023

Team: Jiayi Xia, Jiaqi Wang, Sam Cole

## Introduction

Aging refers to the natural and gradual process of physical, physiological, and psychological changes that occur in living organisms over time. For humans, our lifestyles naturally must change and certain tasks that were once taken for granted can become more difficult as we age and problems with vision, hearing, or mobility begin to arise. For example, according to the CDC, 71% of adults older than 60 report difficulty using print materials, and 68% of adults older than 60 report difficulty interpreting numbers and doing calculations\[1\]. Vision loss affects 37 million Americans older than 50 years and one in four who are older than 80 years\[2\]. One place where visual impairments can lead to problems is when purchasing food at the grocery store, or when determining whether food is good to eat. Additionally, according to the CDC, those 65 and older are at increased risk for food-borne illness, and nearly half of people in this age range who have a lab-confirmed foodborne illness are hospitalized\[3\]. 

After completing our initial research and uncovering these statistics, we formulated the following design question: **How can we make it easy for people who have difficulty reading to quickly determine if food has expired before eating or purchasing.**

## Research Questions

#### User

*   How often do older adults go to the supermarket to buy food?
*   Why do older people find it problematic to read expiration dates on packaging? How do they typically handle the issue of expiration dates while shopping?
*   What type of food are the elderly used to eating?
*   Are there any particular types of products or packaging that vision impaired and the elderly struggle the most with expiration date readability?
*   Does the struggle to read expiration dates correlate to struggles in identifying if foods are fresh without a label?

#### Business

*   Are supermarkets willing to put resources into reading assistance for elderly shoppers?
*   Are there partnerships that could be formed with supermarkets or other organizations to promote and distribute a solution?

#### Technology

*   Can the solution be integrated with other smart home devices or platforms helping them get information from hard to read packaging?
*   Are there computer vision models that can run locally on small devices to detect dates/text?
*   Are there computer vision models that have been developed to detect if foods are fresh just using RGB camera data?

### Core Users

**Tech Companies：**Subsequent design solutions based on smart hardware as well as machine learning need to work with tech companies and require them to provide solutions.

**Supermarket：**It is the place where the act of buying food directly takes place. Supermarkets will decide on their own layout, food placement, and whether or not to implement certain measures.

### Research & Insights

#### Secondary Research

“The date labels on food packaging accompanied by phrases such as “use by,” “best before,” “sell by,” “enjoy by” and “expires on” are generally intended to communicate food quality, not food safety. Nevertheless, date labels exert a powerful influence on consumers and food vendors. Under federal law, date labels are almost entirely unregulated. States have filled the void with a wide variety of regulations that often fail to reflect the distinction between food safety and food quality. The extreme variations demonstrate how our current system creates confusion for consumers while not necessarily improving food safety, ultimately resulting in significant waste of wholesome food.

ReFED found that standardizing date labels nationally was the most cost-effective solution to this country’s food waste problem. The fairly simple solution has the potential to divert 582,000 tons of food waste per year and provide $2.41 billion in annual economic value.” (_Date Labeling Regulations : ReFED | Rethink Food Waste_, n.d.)

*   Many people struggle to read food labels in the supermarket.
*   With 3.3 million Americans over 40 affected by visual impairments, there is a substantial user base for solutions to make food expiration information accessible.
*   The high rate of Americans feeling alone (46%) underscores the importance of empowering individuals, including those with visual impairments, to shop independently.
*   Almost half of seniors hospitalized due to foodborne illnesses signals a need for better support in food safety, especially for vulnerable groups.
*   Food date labels are a significant contributor to food waste
*   Date labels (such as "use by," "best before," etc.) are primarily meant to convey food quality, not food safety.
*   Federal laws provide minimal oversight of date labels, leaving states to develop their own regulations, leading to significant variation across the country.
*   State regulations often fail to distinguish between food safety and food quality, creating confusion for both consumers and food vendors.
*   Examples of state-specific regulations illustrate this arbitrary variability, where some states require date labels on specific food items, restrict the sale of past-date products, or have no requirements at all.
*   Standardizing date labels has the potential to divert a substantial amount of food waste, estimated at 582,000 tons per year.
*   Standardizing date labels could generate $2.41 billion in annual economic value.

#### Field study (Observation)

#### Users and Methodology

Jiayi and Sam conducted an observational study at the supermarket. They observe how shoppers select and inspect food items. Participants included a diverse range of individuals, and the study captured their behaviors, such as examining food items, comparing similar products, and reading labels. Notable findings include variations in how people check food freshness and labels, with some doing so thoroughly while others make quicker selections.

Jiaqi conducted a series of observational studies in home environments to understand how individuals handle food items and make decisions related to their food safety. These studies took place on various dates and locations. Key findings include participants checking the state of food items, examining packaging and labels, and discarding items that did not meet their expectations. The studies also revealed how participants interacted with frozen food and other items in their kitchens.

#### Insights and Analysis

**Diverse User Behaviors:** The observational studies conducted by Jiayi Xia, Sam Cole, and Jiaqi Wang revealed a wide range of behaviors among users when it comes to food selection, label reading, and food safety. Users spanned different age groups and exhibited varying levels of meticulousness and attention to detail.

**Elderly Shoppers:** Elderly shoppers (50-60 years old) often displayed more meticulous behavior when selecting food items. They tended to spend more time examining labels, checking for freshness, and scrutinizing the overall condition of the products. This group valued food safety and freshness, making them a critical target for any solution addressing these concerns.

**Younger Shoppers:** In contrast, younger shoppers, regardless of age, generally made quicker decisions when selecting food. They were more likely to make choices based on visual inspection without extensive label reading or thorough product examination. These users might benefit from solutions that provide quick and reliable food safety information.

**Varied Approaches to Label Reading:** Observations revealed that users had different approaches to reading labels on food items. Some scrutinized labels and expiration dates meticulously, while others paid less attention to these details. This highlights the need for solutions that can adapt to users' individual preferences when it comes to label reading.

**Diverse Domestic Food Handling Practices:** Observational studies in home environments showed that individuals employed different methods to assess food items' freshness, expiration, and overall quality. The studies highlighted the importance of understanding how users interact with food in their homes, especially when dealing with frozen items.

**Potential Business Opportunities:** The insights from these observational studies indicate potential business opportunities for the development of technology solutions, apps, or devices that help users with food safety, label reading, and food item selection, especially for elderly individuals and those with visual impairments.

#### Survey

#### Methodology

Our survey focused on the grocery shopping habits of adults in an effort to see how the average person goes about determining what food is good to eat at the grocery store. The first few questions were demographic in nature and asked about the age of the respondent and how often they visit the grocery store. We then go into questions about what methods respondents use to test foods for freshness and what foods they consider to be the most important for determining freshness. 

We distributed this survey to some of our peers and friends directly, and also posted it on a family member’s facebook page which allowed us to get a lot of data points for older individuals. In total there were 69 respondents at the time of writing this.

#### Insights and Analysis

*   50.7% (35) over the age of 50.
*   63.8% (44) only buying groceries for 1 or 2 people

*   A majority of respondents are the most concerned with the expiration date of fresh produce (eg.Dairy products, fruit, vegetables).
*   Visuals/color are the most important factor to all age groups when choosing vegetables and fruits.
*   Over half of respondents who use glasses said Visuals/color were the most important factor when choosing vegetables and fruits. 
*   Nearly half of the respondents choose produce from the edge or the back of a display in hopes that it is fresher.
*   1 in 5 of those over the age of 50 said it is somewhat or fairly difficult to determine freshness and expiration dates when shopping.
*   One third of respondents said fresh produce is the hardest category of food to determine freshness.
*   4 out of 5 respondents said texture/feel is important when choosing fresh produce.
*   Almost 9 out of 10 respondents said Visuals/Color is important when choosing fresh produce.

## Insights

Legend: secondary study, field study, survey, triangulated insights

### User Experience

*   **Visual Acuity** 

1.  With 3.3 million Americans over 40 affected by visual impairments, there is a substantial user base for solutions to make food expiration information accessible.
2.  71% of adults older than 60 report difficulty using print materials, and 68% of adults older than 60 report difficulty interpreting numbers and doing calculations

*   **Sensory Evaluation**

1.  Many individuals rely on their senses of sight, touch, and smell to assess the freshness and quality of food. This suggests that food packaging and presentation play a crucial role in user experience.
2.  4 out of 5 respondents said texture/feel is important when choosing fresh produce.
3.  Almost 9 out of 10 respondents said Visuals/Color is important when choosing fresh produce.

*   **Label Inspection**

1.  Many people struggle to read food labels in the supermarket.
2.  People do check labels, especially for items like salad, meat, and dairy. This shows that consumers are concerned about expiration dates, nutrition information, and ingredient lists, emphasizing the importance of clear and accessible labeling.
3.  Examples of state-specific regulations illustrate this arbitrary variability, where some states require date labels on specific food items, restrict the sale of past-date products, or have no requirements at all.
4.  Federal laws provide minimal oversight of date labels, leaving states to develop their own regulations, leading to significant variation across the country.
5.  State regulations often fail to distinguish between food safety and food quality, creating confusion for both consumers and food vendors.
6.  1 in 5 respondents said it is somewhat or fairly difficult to determine freshness and expiration dates when shopping.
7.  Date labels (such as "use by," "best before," etc.) are primarily meant to convey food quality, not food safety.
8.  During our field survey we found that elderly shoppers were more meticulous when examining food.
9.  Examining labels is not a simple task and be confusing or inconvenient to shoppers.

*   **Touch and Feel**

1.  People often physically interact with food items, like squeezing lemons or feeling the texture of produce. This tactile experience can influence their choices and satisfaction.
2.  Almost half of the respondents use touch and feel to check the status of food.

*   **Comparative Shopping**

1.  Customers compare different items, such as selecting the freshest fruits or the best deals on sale items. User experience can be enhanced by providing clear product comparisons and recommendations in-store or through technology.
2.  Nearly half of the respondents choose produce from the edge or the back of a display in hopes that it is fresher and not been touched by others.
3.  A majority of respondents are the most concerned with the expiration date of fresh produce (eg.Dairy products, fruit, vegetables).

*   **Attention to Packaging**

1.  Users pay attention to the condition of packaging, such as checking for damaged or crushed items. This highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity of packaging and ensuring it conveys quality and freshness.

### Business

The location of products on shelves matters. Items placed deep within shelves might not be as appealing as those easily accessible. 

Transparent packaging plays a crucial role in customer decisions. It allows customers to visually assess the quality of the product, which can influence purchase decisions.

Standardizing date labels could generate $2.41 billion in annual economic value.

Almost 9 out of 10 respondents visit the grocery store at least once a week

### Technology

**Smart labels:** Integrating technology into food packaging, such as smart labels that provide real-time information on product freshness, can enhance the user experience and build trust with customers.

**Mobile apps:** Retailers can develop mobile apps that provide detailed product information, including expiration dates and nutritional content, allowing customers to make informed choices while shopping.

Smart shelter: Smart shelves may make it easier to shop for food and recognize freshness.

## Prioritised set of design requirements 

##  User Experience

**User-Friendly Interface (High Priority)**: The solution should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface to accommodate older adults with varying levels of technology proficiency.

71% of adults older than 60 report difficulty using print materials, and 68% of adults older than 60 report difficulty interpreting numbers and doing calculations.

**Quick Date Checking (High Priority)**: Users should be able to quickly check expiration dates on food packaging without the need for extensive reading. 

Federal laws provide minimal oversight of date labels, leaving states to develop their own regulations, leading to significant variation across the country. According to our survey 1 in 5 respondents said it is somewhat or fairly difficult to determine freshness and expiration dates when shopping

**Accessibility Features (High Priority)**: The solution should include accessibility features like adjustable text size and voice guidance for those with vision impairments.

With 3.3 million Americans over 40 affected by visual impairments, there is a substantial user base for solutions to make food expiration information accessible.

**Comparative Hands Free Produce Shopping (Med Priority):** Users should be able to compare multiple fresh produce items hands free to determine freshness.

According to our survey, nearly half of the respondents choose produce from the edge or the back of a display in hopes that it is fresher and not been touched by others. Also according to our survey the majority of respondents are the most concerned with the expiration date of fresh produce (eg.Dairy products, fruit, vegetables).

**Category-Specific Information (Med Priority)**: The system should prioritize displaying expiration information for categories of food that users are most concerned about, such as fresh produce (e.g., dairy, fruit, vegetables).

Our secondary research shows that date labels (such as "use by," "best before," etc.) are primarily meant to convey food quality, not food safety. And our survey’s data shows a majority of respondents are the most concerned with the expiration date of fresh produce (eg.Dairy products, fruit, vegetables).

**Lightweight and easy to carry (Med Priority)**: It should not be a burden for users to carry our products when they go to the grocery store

From our field study we found that elderly shoppers were more meticulous when examining food and it is reasonable to assume this group would not want a product that is too cumbersome.

**Visual Feedback (Low Priority)**: The solution should provide clear visual feedback, such as color-coding or symbols, to help users identify the freshness status of food items.

While Visual Feedback can be beneficial, it's crucial to ensure that the primary functionality, which is providing accessible and understandable information about food freshness, is well-implemented and user-friendly first.

**User Customization (Low Priority)**: Users should have the option to customize the interface, text size, and preferred visual feedback to accommodate their individual preferences. Because we may have users who speak different languages, users with poor eyesight, etc.

## Business

**Supermarket Collaboration (High Priority)**: Establish partnerships or collaborations with supermarkets to promote and distribute the solution in-store, making it more accessible to older shoppers. Our ultimate solution needs to allow users to have a good shopping experience at the same time not to cause trouble to the supermarket, and to a certain extent to increase the supermarket's profits so that they are willing to enter into cooperation with us.

Almost 9 out of 10 respondents from our survey visit the grocery store at least once a week.

**Resource Allocation (High Priority):** Supermarkets should be willing to allocate resources to support reading assistance for elderly shoppers. Supermarkets can allocate resources to integrate the solution into their infrastructure, making it readily available to elderly shoppers, especially those who may struggle with reading expiration dates. This directly addresses the user's needs.

Standardizing date labels could save $2.41 billion in wasted products, showing that there is real economic incentive for companies to allocate resources towards this, even if that is just providing inventory data and what's currently available on the shelves.

**Economical for the user (Med Priority)**: The final product needs to be affordable for most users.

Our solution is targeting an older demographic who is around retirement age and we want our solution to fit within anyone's budget who is on a modest fixed income.

**Marketing and Awareness(Low Priority)**: Implement marketing strategies to raise awareness about the solution among both supermarkets and elderly customers. 

The research data indicates that there is a significant need for a solution to assist individuals, particularly elderly customers, in determining food freshness and expiration dates.

## Technology

**Real-Time Data Updates(High Priority)**: Ensure the solution can receive real-time data updates about food products, including expiration dates and freshness assessments.

State-specific regulations can require date labels on specific food items, restrict the sale of past-date products, or have no requirements at all. Federal laws provide minimal oversight of date labels, leaving states to develop their own regulations, leading to significant variation across the country.

**Ease of Maintenance (Med Priority)**: The technology should be designed for easy maintenance and updates, reducing downtime and ensuring continuous functionality.

Almost 9 out of 10 survey respondents visit the grocery store at least once a week. So excessive downtime due to bugs or hardware problems is not ideal.

**Integration with Smart Home Devices (Low Priority)**: The solution should be compatible with various smart home devices or platforms to provide information from hard-to-read packaging.

The main target demographic includes elderly individuals and those with visual impairments who may have limited experience with or access to smart home devices.

## Design Question Iteration

## Refined Design Question

How can we develop a user-friendly, technology-driven solution in collaboration with supermarkets to assist older adults in quickly determining the freshness or expiration of food items during grocery shopping?

## Justification

The refinement of the design question addresses the specific needs and priorities of older adults, including their preference for category-specific information and user-friendly design. It also incorporates the collaborative aspect with supermarkets, which is a key business requirement. This refined question provides clear guidance for developing a solution that aligns with the user, business, and technology requirements identified in the research.

## Appendices

## Field Research Plan

**Q1. What is the overall design question your study is intended to address?**

How can we make it easy for people who have difficulty reading to quickly determine if food has expired?

**Q3a. Describe 2-3 activities or tasks that lead up to the main concept(s) that you want to learn about (pre-activity) and 2-3 post-activities or tasks. Refer to our example in studio about Activity Lifecycle.**

**Home:**

**Pre:** 

*   Be hungry for a meal.
*   Prepare to go shopping 

**Post:**

*   By observing the situation of the food to determine whether it is edible
*   Cook with fresh food.
*   Throw away food that has gone bad

**Supermarket:**

**Pre:**

*   Identify that they need to buy food by checking the fridge, pantry, etc.
*   Bring and wear glasses or magnifiers for poor vision.
*   Walk to the relevant merchandise area.

**Post:**

*   Organize and put the food in the fridge
*   May recheck dates to decide where to put food.

**Q3b.  What are the field research questions that will help you learn more about your design question?  Identify all relevant areas of focus (Focal Points)  (of the 10 listed in Baxter et. al, pg 390) and write 2 or 3 questions or statements you would like to learn about in your field observations for EACH relevant focal point. Reference our lecture slide examples.**

**Food and Drinks:**

*   What types of food do people pay more attention to when they are shopping in the supermarket?
*   How much time do people spend checking expiration dates when shopping at the supermarket?
*   What do normal people do when they want to check the date during shopping?
*   How do people determine whether food is edible at home when there is no labeled date?

**Demographics:**

*   What kind of people have difficulty with reading/understanding expiration labels?
*   Are people who have trouble reading labels generally alone or with someone else?
*   What types of people will pay more attention to the date when buying food? Their age/ gender?

**Overall Experience:**

*   Does it take individuals a long time to determine if food is bad?
*   What are the pain points of checking the quality of food?

**Tools and Technology:**

*   What kind of tools do people use to find out if food is good?
*   Do people often use other tools to help them determine if it’s good condition?

**Q4.  Who are you going to observe during your field observations? What are the characteristics of these people? and Why are you focusing on this group? Your solution may or may not be targeted at this audience.**

People have difficulties in reading.

*   People with limited mobility（Difficulty holding food for long periods of time/difficulty turning food with crutches）
*   People with significant visual impairment: people with presbyopia /glasses, people who need to look at food very closely
*   Most of seniors（slow motion）

Reason:

*   This group is clearly characterized and relatively easy to distinguish. And these people are our main target group for DQ.
*   This group usually has more difficulty than others in distinguishing whether food is fresh or not.

**Q5.  Do you need to gain permission to observe in your chosen people/activity/environment? If so, how will you gain permission to conduct your field study ?  How will you recruit?**

*   In the supermarket we may need to notify the employees we are taking observations for a study so as not to raise an alarm. If we want to observe people picking food in the supermarket, we will keep a distance to watch. However, if we want to take photos to record their behaviors, we will ask for their permission.

*   For observing people in their homes we will definitely need to ask permission. We can firstly start with our classmate and investigate who cooks frequently and have difficulty identifying expired food. We will go to their house to observe their cooking and  their behavior with the food in the refrigerator. We can also ask elderly neighbors if they would allow us to observe them cooking for 30 mins.

**Q6.  What ethical considerations might come into play during your field study?**

Reference Courage and Baxter Chapter 3 for details.

**Home:** We do need permission if we want to enter, observe someone and take photos at their home.

**Supermarket:** If we are just observing people, we just keep a distance and observe. If taking photos to document, do we need to ask before or after taking photos.

**Q7.  What is your overall logic for conducting each of the three observation sessions?**

*   Where will you do the observations?
    *   Safeway, QFC, and personal homes
*   when will you do the observations (date)

To observe in the supermarket, we will conduct observations on weekends. We anticipate that the supermarket will be more crowded during this time, allowing us to observe a larger number of people's behavior.

For observing individual people at their homes, we will focus on their meal preparation time.

**Q8.  How do you plan to collect data?**

Be as detailed as possible and include your reasoning for your data collection approach.

**Supermarket:**

We will observe shoppers in the bread, dairy and produce aisles. We will note how long they take to observe food before placing it in their cart and what methods they use to examine the food, such as smell, touch, rotating packaging, comparing different items, and note how much of the packaging they observe/read.

**Kitchen:**

We will observe how people recognize when/if food is spoiled and categorize it. We will observe how people recognize when food is spoiled and categorize it. And record the time they consume in the process of finding the shelf life.

Afterwards we can compare the data recorded in different scenarios: in what way do people distinguish the shelf life of food and whether it has expired? In which scenarios is the time consumed the longest?

## 2\. Field Study Notes

### Jiayi Xia’s field study notes

**Goal:** I’m going to observe the pre-activity of people purchasing and preparing food before they place it in the refrigerator. I'm interested in how they select food. Do they read labels? How do they check the labels? What behavior do they have?

**Methods:** I recorded a 30-minute audio recording of the people's behavior in Trader Joe’s Bellevue. Then go home and listen the record translating the note into text.

**Date:** 25th Oct, 2023

**Time:** 6:17 pm- 6:47 pm

**Location:** Trader Joe’s Bellevue (416 116th Ave NE, Bellevue, WA 98004)

### Jiaqi Wang’s field study notes

**Field 1**

Date: Oct 24,2023

Location: Zia’s home

Time: 14:31 p.m.

Scenario：Zia prepares lunch in the kitchen while I sit in the living room and observe.

Premise: I did not inform Zia that I would be at her house and she did not prepare the food in advance. She's somewhat nearsighted but wears contact lenses.
